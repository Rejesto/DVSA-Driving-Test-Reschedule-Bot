# Driving Test Cancellations
A simple Python bot which will send you an email when driving test cancellations become available at the selected test center.

## Cloud Connection (Coming Soon)
We are hoping to allow you to connect your bot to our cloud serivces at https://copadrivingtest.co.uk/ soon so that you can easily manage cancellations via SMS through our website. Check back soon for an update!

## About
Due to current high demand for driving tests I have built a simple python script which will quickly check the driving test booking page for any available tests and email you if there are any free. It is also free to use and fairly simple, just put your current test in to the script file and it will do the rest for you.

## Requirements
- Latest version of captcha buster https://github.com/dessant/buster/releases/latest
- Google Chrome (https://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/chrome/) or Chromium
- PIP packages:
- - selenium
- - undetected-chromedriver
- - configparser

## Limitations
- You cannot book tests unless you are at the computer. However, this will be fixed soon with our cloud connection.
- It gets stuck waiting for a user input on weather to book a test.
